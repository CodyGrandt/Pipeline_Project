# Source Code Version Control Tools

## Introduction
* **Version Control** is vital in software development for a multitide of reasons.  The most important use of version control is as the name describes: "*version control*," means that commiting changes to your code in your desired version control system, you are then able to "**control which version**" of your code you wish to easily view or make changes to.  This eliminates the stress of accidentally losing important code, or having your code work during one version then break it at a later version.
* The use of **Version Control** is even more beneficial when collaborating in teams on a project.  Version control allows and provides a detailed history of changes made to files so you can see who made changes to a file, when they were made, and why they were made.  This is even more beneficial when the user adds commit messages to document their changes as they made and upload them.  Version control also allows for other vital documents, such as a README and even the file you are currently reading to exist, providing even more information about the project at hand.  All of the documentation previously mentioned is invaluable in software development and streamlines the development process.
* Also, through the use of a code editor such as **Visual Studio Code**, anyone with access to the repository where these files exist can easily copy all of the necessary files for software development directly from the repository onto their machine.  From there they can edit said files, then commit the changes they make directly back into the repository.  This provides quite literally the easiest and most efficient way for all team members to access all of the files needed, without having to directly ask for one member to send files to another, or any other nightmare scenario you could come up with.
