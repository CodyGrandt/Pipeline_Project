# Source Code Version Control Tools

## Introduction
* **Version Control** is vital in software development for a multitide of reasons.  The most important use of version control is as the name describes: "*version control*," means that commiting changes to your code in your desired version control system, you are then able to "*control which version*" of your code you wish to easily view or make changes to.  This eliminates the stress of accidentally losing important code, or having your code work during one version then break it at a later version.
* The use of **Version Control** is even more beneficial when collaborating in teams on a project.  Version control allows and provides a detailed history of changes made to files so you can see who made changes to a file, when they were made, and why they were made.  This is even more beneficial when the user adds commit messages to document their changes as they made and upload them.  Version control also allows for other vital documents, such as a README and even the file you are currently reading to exist, providing even more information about the project at hand.  All of the documentation previously mentioned is invaluable in software development and streamlines the development process.
* Also, through the use of a code editor such as **Visual Studio Code**, anyone with access to the repository where these files exist can easily copy all of the necessary files for software development directly from the repository onto their machine.  From there they can edit said files, then commit the changes they make directly back into the repository.  This provides quite literally the easiest and most efficient way for all team members to access all of the files needed, without having to directly ask for one member to send files to another, or any other nightmare scenario you could come up with.
## Version Control System Used
* The Version Control System (VCS) I used for this project is **GitHub**.  The main reason I chose GitHub over other Version Control Systems, such as GitLab, is that when preparing for the original DevContainer assignment, I was researching this task and almost every video or article I saw was using GitHub.  Also, while I had never used a VCS in the past, it was the only system that I was even remotely familiar with, and this was the VCS that Professor Munday elected to use as well.
* I wanted to do a little more research before committing to a VCS though, and this is when I discovered **GitHub actions**.  This is a feature within GitHub that allows you to almost instantly creat, build, test, and deploy a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for your projects.  Since this was one of the main goals of this project, I felt that this was going to be a major help in the production process of this project.  Besides this major feature, GitHub also boasts other very useful features such as code reveiw tools, issue tracking, branching, merging, pull requests, etc., which all aid in the devlopment process.  I also felt like since GitHub was the most popular VCS, it would be more likely that another classmate or the professor would be able to help me in the event that I had an issue.  Finally, since I felt that GitHub had the cleanest and most familiar feeling user interface, I elected to use GitHub as my Version Control System.
