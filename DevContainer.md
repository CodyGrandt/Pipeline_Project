# DevContainer Environment

## Introduction
* A **DevContainer** is essentially a containerized development environment.  This means that All of the tools, dependencies, and configurations needed for a specific project (in our case, our web application) are stored in a container.
    * The main goal of utilizing DevContainers is to eliminate the "*it works on my machine*" issue.  
    * By providing all of the files necessary in working on a specific project into a container, deploying these files to a version control software (in my case, GitHub), and running this container on a program such as Docker, each collaborator can easily be deployed to the exact same environment, eliminating compatability issues and streamlining the development process.
    * In our use case, this is extremely important when collaborating with the Professor, to which they can open our Flutter web applications in the exact same environment as we do, so they can experience and help with the exact same issues without needing to have access to the students device.
